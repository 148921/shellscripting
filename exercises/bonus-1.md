# Bonus Exercise 1 - Done with time to spare?

You will learn to:

  - Use parameters in your script

## 1.1 Parameters

:book: Try to make your deploy-script use parameters with `getopt`s! 
- the parameters and their uses are: 
  - `-d` cleans the build, that is deletes all compiled classes and the directory they've been put in
  - `-c` compiles all java source files in a classes directory
  - `-j` make a jar of all class files
  - `-u` upload jar file to remote location
  - `-h` display usage
- When you run the script it should look like this (when you invoke all the steps): 
`bash myscript.sh -dcju`
